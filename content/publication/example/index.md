abstract: We study the statistical fluctuations of Lyapunov exponents in the
  discrete version of the non-integrable perturbed sine-Gordon equation, the
  dissipative AC- and DC-driven Frenkel–Kontorova model. Our analysis shows that
  the fluctuations of the exponent spacings in the strictly overdamped limit,
  which is nonchaotic, conform to an uncorrelated Poisson distribution. By
  studying the spatiotemporal dynamics, we relate the emergence of the
  Poissonian statistics to Middleton's no-passing rule. Next, by scanning values
  of the DC drive and the particle mass, we identify several parameter regions
  for which this one-dimensional model exhibits hyperchaotic behavior.
  Furthermore, in the hyperchaotic regime where roughly fifty percent of the
  exponents are positive, the fluctuations exhibit features of the correlated
  universal statistics of the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE). Due to the
  dissipative nature of the dynamics, we find that the match between the
  Lyapunov spectrum statistics and the universal statistics of GOE is not
  complete. Finally, we present evidence supporting the existence of the
  Tracy–Widom distribution in the fluctuation statistics of the largest Lyapunov
  exponent.
